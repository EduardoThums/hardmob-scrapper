## Installation

### Configure drivers
Selinium uses interface drivers to work with browsers, so you need to download a driver of your preference and put it into ```drivers``` folder.
For more information about how Selenium work with drivers see [Selenium Drivers](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers)
